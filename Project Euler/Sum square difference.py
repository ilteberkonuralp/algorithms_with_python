"""The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
                sum((1:10)^2)=385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
                    sum(1:10)^2=3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers 
and the square of the sum is .
                3025-385=2640
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural
 numbers and the square of the sum."""
